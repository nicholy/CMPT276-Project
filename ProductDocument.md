### __Details of Software Methodology__

<br>    Members are expected to follow an incremental development model while working on the project,
<br>    where the project will be divided into smaller releases. Early releases would consist of the core properties of Chip-8, with later releases containing various add-ons(the games, the application).

### __Testing and Quality Assurance Tools__

<br>    Tools we will use for testing and assuring the quality would consist of  Javascript Sandbox and a manual code in a separate Javascript file(Build up with each release).

### __Main Implementation Language/ Software Repository (UPDATED)__

<br>   Main implementation language would be JavaScript and code will be stored using Google Drive during coding stages while the Final update of the code will be stored in GitHub.

### __Detailed Use Cases For Next Release ( UPDATED )__

**Sound/Timers**
<br> - Display fps and make a beep noise when the game needs

**Running Display**
<br> - Usable display that shows the game running.

**Hex Keyboard**
<br> - Usable Keyboard for playing a game

**Chip 8 Tool**
<br> - Sprite Editor - By Release 2 have entire concept fleshed out, and parts of code completed

**Game 1**
<br> - Create Start up animation for the game (Snake)

**Visualizer**
<br> - Finishing the visualizer, prints out opcode operation while the game is running

### __Release 1 Discussions**(NEW):**__
<ul style = "font-size : 17.5px;">
  <li> Visualizer completion pushed to release 2 - visualizer is just a log of the first 1000 operations of the program loaded into memory</li>
  <li> Screen completion (animations) for the programs and games done by release 2 - using window.requestAnimationFrame object - need more in depth research</li>
  <li> Currently with the load function, it is possible to load anything. We want to make it only possible to run the rom files in a specified folder so it wont give any errors
  <li> One of the problems that was encountered was that one of our team members did not do any of the work associated with release one. Because of this, some progress was pushed back to later releases, making the development process frustrating to work on with the remaining team members. On top of that, it was very difficult to contact him, as he does not read any forms of communication that we have been using as a group. Attendance to meetings has been sparse (he have not come to the past 6 meetings). As a temporary solution, the group has decided to split up the code amongst the four remaining members. </li>
</ul>
