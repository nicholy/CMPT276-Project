## INSTRUCTIONS:

<h2> **Automated Testing**</h2>
<p style = "font-size : 17.5px;"> Open load.html then click on the automatic testing icon to test each opcode, stacks and memory
<br> -In each testing case the Opcode number and the testing result is displayed in bold font
<br> -Details for each test are directly under the bolded title and are indented(using the &nbsp tag) </p>

<h3> **Details**</h3>
<p style = "font-size : 17.5px;"> Each Test will give an output at the end of the line, displaying whether the test operation performed was a success. The way the opcodes were tested was through using sample data stored in various variables, using a check Boolean to determine success or failure. The results are then printed with a check or a cross mark. For DXYN(The Screen Opcode), we have provided a sample display with one sprite(0) printed on it to show that the display function does work. We have not included several of the opcodes(the hex keyboard, timers, and sound), as we have not programmed </p>

<h2> **Running Code** </h2>
<br> Open load.html that should take you to the canvas for our chip-8 emulator
<br> select a ROM file from the files that were provided
<br> Only the initial page of the game should load on the screen
