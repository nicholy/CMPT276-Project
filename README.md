# CMPT276 TEAM 3 RELEASE 1

## INSTRUCTIONS:

<h2>Automated Testing</h2>


<ul style = "font-size : 17.5px;">
<li> Open load.html then click on the automatic testing icon to test each opcode, stacks and memory</li>
<li> In each testing case the Opcode number and the testing result is displayed in bold font</li>
<li> Details for each test are directly under the bolded title and are indented(using the &nbsp tag)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Details</h3>
<p style = "font-size : 17.5px;"> Each Test will give an output at the end of the line, displaying whether the test operation performed was a success. The way the opcodes were tested was through using sample data stored in various variables, using a check Boolean to determine success or failure. The results are then printed with a check or a cross mark. For DXYN(The Screen Opcode), we have provided a sample display with one sprite(0) printed on it to show that the display function does work(must be viewed with 100% screen size to view best). We have not included several of the opcodes(the hex keyboard, timers, and sound), as we have not programmed that as features yet.</p>

<h2>Running Code</h2>
<ul style = "font-size : 17.5px;">
<li>Open load.html that should take you to the canvas for our chip-8 emulator</li>
<li>Select a ROM file from the files that were provided</li>
<li>Only the initial page of the game should load on the screen</li>
<li>The screen is a "snapshot" of the 1000th frame, animations will be included in later releases (only to show that opcode is running)</li>
<li>Visualizer can be viewed by going into the console (pressing F12 or going into developer mode and looking at the console)</li>
</ul>

### DISCUSSIONS:
<ul>
  <li> Visualizer completion pushed to release 2 - visualizer is just a "screenshot" for now</li>
  <li>
</ul>
